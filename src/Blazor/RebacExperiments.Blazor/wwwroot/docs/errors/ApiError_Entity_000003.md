# Entity has been edited by a different user (ApiError_Entity_000003)

The entity you are working on has been edited by a different user. You could either 
reload and inspect the changes made by the user, or you are overriding the other 
users values.

Please note, that no values will be lost by overriding. The system tracks and audits 
all changes, which allows it to inspect and restore the previous state of the given 
entity. 

Please contact the support, if you think this is not correct.
